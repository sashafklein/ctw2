***JUNE 11***

Mongoid and Devise now (seem to) work nicely together
Basic authentication is up
Basic authorization is up for user pages
Basic workout/user pages are up and need some major re-styling. Next, I plan to:
- create all the other models
- validate data entry
- build/plan out all views

Longer-term and random task list:
- stylin'
- attr_accessible
- phone functionality / twilio integration
- basic text search
- gym pages
- mobile stylin'
- start using
- stripe
- inspirational twitter feed?
