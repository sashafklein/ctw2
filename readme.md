***UPDATE***

Added some stuff, but the Mongo/Mongoid configuration isn't complete yet. I have two overlapping files, and I'm not sure which is right yet, so the database stuff isn't quite working yet.

Next on my agenda:
- Fixing the above
- Sessions controller/authorization
- User infrastructure
- Responsive design
